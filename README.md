# Devember 2021 - TwitchBot

This repository represents my entry into [Devember](https://devember.org/) 2021
and is a simple Twitch bot written in JavaScript and NodeJS for use as a
[NodeCG](http://github.com/nodecg/nodecg) bundle.

Development work is being done this year on my [Twitch channel](https://twitch.tv/odatnurd)
which is also serving as the daily devlog; what better way to follow what the
day's work was than to actually watch the day's work.
